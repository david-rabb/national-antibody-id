# Proposal for a National Antibody ID
To minimize the spread of infectious diseaes, a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) ecosystem could quickly and non-invasively check an individual's known health status. The ID system can be thought of as a boarding pass as used for airline passengers with extra gaurantees of privacy, authenticity and flexibility. Individuals would present their Antibody ID when entering buildings, sensitive areas (nursing homes, meeting with leaders) or other large gatherings.
